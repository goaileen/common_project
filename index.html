                Yugi is a 7 year old chihuahua who loves love and adores attention. A member of the sassy dog community, he is full of personality and character with a response for everything. Nicknamed King Yugi, he holds himself as a true royal and leader of the home, being given all the luxuries in life by his humans.

            <p>
                With the ability to love beyond his small body, Yugi is an attached lap dog that loves to be your sidekick. Protective, caring, and cuddly, there is never a time he isn’t there to support you and is always prepared for a short-notice nap time.
